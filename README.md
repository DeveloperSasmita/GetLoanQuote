2. Sample LenderData.csv file is at src\test\resources\

If run using JAR (Optional port)                                                        
`java -jar target/quote-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8080`                                         
Property can be passed in the command line to override the configuration provided in
the [configuration](src/main/resources/application.properties)
